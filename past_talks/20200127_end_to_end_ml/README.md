# End-to-End Machine Learning

Talk delivered on 15:00-16:00 on Monday 27th January 2020 in Meeting Room 9.

Harriet talked about about the steps in a typical Machine Learning project, borrowing from the second chapter of Aurelien Geron’s “Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow”.
It will hopefully be useful as a refresher for those familiar with building end-to-end machine learning projects, and an introduction for those starting out in data science. All levels welcome.
