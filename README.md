# ONS London Coffee & Coding

The aim of the Coffee & Coding meetups is to nurture, enable and encourage a
vibrant, supportive and inclusive coding community at ONS. Coffee & Coding
provides a regular opportunity for people within ONS who are interested in
coding to share skills and knowledge, provide advice and guidance to each other
and generally network and get to know each other.

The format is generally 40 minutes for a presentation and questions to the
presenter/s followed by an informal Code Surgery. The presentations usually take
the form of a demonstration of a tool or technique and/or a show and tell of
work done within the department using these methods. From time to time we will
invite external speakers. The Code Surgery provides the opportunity for people
to pose any coding related queries/ruminations/ideas to the gathered coding
community.
